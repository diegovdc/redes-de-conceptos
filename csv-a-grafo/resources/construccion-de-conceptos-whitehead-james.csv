First, that the movement of historical, and philosophical, criticism of detached questions, which on the whole has dominated the last two centuries, has done its work, and requires to be supplemented by a more sustained effort of constructive thought. Secondly, that the true method of philosophical construction is to frame a scheme of ideas, the best that one can, and unflinchingly to explore the interpretation of experience in terms of that scheme. Thirdly, that all constructive thought, on the various special topics of scientific interest, is dominated by some such scheme, unacknowledged, but no less influential in guiding the imagination. The importance of philosophy lies in its sustained effort to make such schemes explicit, and thereby capable of criticism and improvement.","teorización / ejemplificación

One test of success is adequacy in the comprehension of the variety of experience within the limits of one scheme of ideas. The endeavour to satisfy this condition is illustrated by comparing Chapters III, VII, and X of Part II, respectively entitled 'The Order of Nature,' 'The Subjectivist Principle,' and 'Process,' with Chapter [x] V of Part III, entitled 'The Higher Phases of Experience,' and with Chapter V of Part IV, entitled 'Measurement,' and with Chapter II of Part V, entitled 'God and thet World.' These chapters should be recognizable as the legitimate outcome of the one scheme of ideas stated in the second chapter of Part I.

rigid systematism,"a careful examination of their exact statements disclosed that in the main the philosophy of organism is a recurrence to pre-Kantian modes of thought. These philosophers were perplexed by the inconsistent presuppositions underlying their inherited modes of expression.
